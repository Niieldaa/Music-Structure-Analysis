# ðŸŽ¶ Music Structure Analysis

**MED 4 Project â€“ EDM Track Segmentation**

This project focuses on the structural analysis of EDM (Electronic Dance Music) tracks by segmenting them based on musical features such as **Chroma** and **Tempo**. The goal is to develop an algorithm capable of identifying patterns and transitions in the music, dividing them into segments.

ðŸ“‚ **Final Algorithm:**  
You can find the final implementation in the following Jupyter notebook:
